# Killer-Shrimp-Invasion-Ocean-Data-Factory-Sweden
--My personal take on the Kaggle challenge of predictin the presence of an invasive species of shrimps in the waters of the Nordic sea.-- 

The goal of this challenge is to spur researchers around the world to build innovative machine learning solutions to help monitoring and prediction of invasive species. The challenge focuses on one specific species, the so-called "Killer Shrimp" (Dikerogammarus Villosus), and its spread in the Baltic Sea. The results can be applied to other species as well.

Invasive Species have become a growing problem in the recent past, causing severe harm to marine ecosystems and those who depend on them The economic impact alone amounts to several billion dollars annually.

This dataset is particularly interesting since its a heavily imbalanced one. Almost 99.998% of the data is related to one category, and the task is to accurately predict the "positive" category, since the killer shrimp can be hazardous if not detected.
